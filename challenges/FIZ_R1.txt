FIZ_R1
ROUND 1 - Fizz Buzz
You are given a number. You have to follow the following rules:
  - If the number is a multiple of three then you should write "fizz"
  - If the number is a multiple of five then you should write "buzz"
  - If the number is a multiple of both three and five then you should write "fizz buzz"
  - If the number is not a multiple of five or three then write the number, example 1

Notes: 
 - You do not have to test for illegal input.
 - The input numbers are between 1-9999

In order to complete the round you need to implement the following method:
     fizz_buzz(Integer) -> String

Where:
 - param[0] = an Integer between 1-9999
 - @return = a String containing either the number, "fizz", "buzz" or "fizz buzz"
