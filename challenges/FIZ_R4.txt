ROUND 4 - Fizz Buzz Fake Deluxe
The Deluxe version was a huge success ! Still, we are getting some negative feedback.
Turns out that people do not like odd numbers, they call them "fake".
The want us to change the Deluxe version so that:
  - If a "deluxe" number is odd, we should call him "fake deluxe"
  - A number cannot be both "deluxe" and "fake deluxe" at the same time
  - All the previous rules are still valid

Notes: 
 - You do not have to test for illegal input.
 - The input numbers are between 1-9999

In order to complete the round you need to implement the following method:
     fizz_buzz(Integer) -> String

Where:
 - param[0] = an Integer between 1-9999
 - @return = a String containing either the number or the correct combination of "fizz", "buzz", "deluxe" and "fake deluxe"
