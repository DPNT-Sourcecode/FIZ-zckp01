FIZ_R2
ROUND 2 - Fizz Buzz variation
Let's change the rules a little bit:
  - A number is "fizz" if it is divisible by 3 or if it has a 3 in it
  - A number is "buzz" if it is divisible by 5 or if it has a 5 in it
  - A number can be both "fizz" and "buzz" at the same time. If this happens then write "fizz buzz"

Notes: 
 - You do not have to test for illegal input.
 - The input numbers are between 1-9999

In order to complete the round you need to implement the following method:
     fizz_buzz(Integer) -> String

Where:
 - param[0] = an Integer between 1-9999
 - @return = a String containing either the number or the correct combination of "fizz" and "buzz"
