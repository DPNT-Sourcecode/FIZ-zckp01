ROUND 5 - Fizz Buzz Better and Improved Deluxe
Well done implementing the "fake deluxe" feature ! It had completely won the upper class people's hearts.
Now, it is time to expand to a different market. Meet the hipsters !
Our market research team came back with some interesting findings.
Turns out that the hipsters do not like our "deluxe" because all the digits are the same.
It is time to completely change the "deluxe" concept such that:
  - The old rules for "deluxe" do not apply.
  - A number is "fizz deluxe" if it is divisible by 3 AND it has a 3 in it
  - A number is "buzz deluxe" if it is divisible by 5 AND it has a 5 in it
  - We should still say "fake deluxe" if the "deluxe" number is odd
  - A number can be "fizz", "buzz" and "deluxe" at the same time. If this happens then write "fizz buzz deluxe"
  - All the previous rules for "fizz" and "buzz" are still valid

Notes: 
 - You do not have to test for illegal input.
 - The input numbers are between 1-9999

In order to complete the round you need to implement the following method:
     fizz_buzz(Integer) -> String

Where:
 - param[0] = an Integer between 1-9999
 - @return = a String containing either the number or the correct combination of "fizz", "buzz", "deluxe" and "fake deluxe"
