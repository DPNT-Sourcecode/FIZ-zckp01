ROUND 3 - Fizz Buzz Deluxe
People like "fizz buzz" but the upper class of the society wants more. Let's create a "Deluxe" version !
It goes like this, we are going to add a new rule:
  - A number is considered to be "deluxe" if it is greater than 10 and all the digits are identical
  - A number can be "fizz", "buzz" and "deluxe" at the same time. If this happens then write "fizz buzz deluxe"

Notes: 
 - You do not have to test for illegal input.
 - The input numbers are between 1-9999

In order to complete the round you need to implement the following method:
     fizz_buzz(Integer) -> String

Where:
 - param[0] = an Integer between 1-9999
 - @return = a String containing either the number or the correct combination of "fizz", "buzz" and "deluxe"
